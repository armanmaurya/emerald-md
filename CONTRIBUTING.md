Please make sure the following is done before submitting a PR:

If you add new feature:

- Open a suggestion issue first.
- Provide your reasoning on why you want to add this feature.
- Submit your PR.

If you fix a bug:

- If you are resolving a special issue, please add `fix: #<issue number> <short message>` in your PR title (e.g.`fix: #3899 update entities encoding/decoding`).

### Where should I start?

A good way to start is to find an [issue](https://github.com/armanmaurya/emerald-md/issues) labeled as `bug`, `help wanted` or `feature request`. The `good first issue` issues are good for newcomers. Please discuss the solution for larger issues first and after the final solution is approved by the MarkText members, you can submit/work on the PR. For small changes you can directly open a PR.
